This chapter reflects on the results presented in Chapter 4 and discusses how they address
the research questions, the implications of the findings, and possible directions for future
work.
\section{Interpretation of Results}
\subsection{Accuracy and Robustness  }
The results demonstrate that integrating a prior 3D map into a LiDAR-inertial localization framework significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.By aligning real-time LiDAR scans with globally consistent reference  map , the system reduces drift that typically accumulates in odometry-only methods.Experimental results from multiple datasets show that the proposed system achieves centimeter- to decimeter-level translational RMSE(see  Table ~\ref{tab:ape_rot_saxion_seq1} ,\ref{tab:ape_rot_saxion_seq2}, \ref{tab:ape_rot_saxion_seq3}), while standalone LiDAR-Inertial Odometry exhibits drift ranging from meter-level to over ten meters in extended trajectories.Unlike SLAM approaches that rely on loop closures, this method consistently aligns live LiDAR scans to a static reference map, maintaining accuracy even in environments with sparse or unreliable loop opportunities(Table ~\ref{tab:ape_rot_kitti_seq5}).

To effectively combine high-frequency LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (FAST-LIO2) with
NDT-based map matching, the proposed system employs a factor graph optimization frame-
work.The factor graph fuses odometry and scan-matching constraints into a consistent probabilistic model, reducing accumulated linearization errors compared to filtering methods.The sliding-window strategy further ensures real-time performance by limiting the optimization to a fixed temporal window, maintaining constant computational cost regardless of trajectory length (see Figure \ref{fig:computation_summary}).This
design effectively mitigates drift in odometry and compensates for scan-matching failures,
preserving both short-term precision and long-term consistency in challenging environments.

\subsection{Real-Time Performance }

Results show that while standard NDT and ICP struggle to meet real-time constraints as map size  increases often resulting in slow convergence or failure, the proposed approach maintains reliable performance (Table \ref{tab:scanmap_radius}). By operating on locally segmented submaps and leveraging multithreaded NDT-OMP, the system ensures fast and stable scan matching.To manage computational load in large-scale environments, the system incorporates dynamic submap loading and tile-based map management. Instead of operating on a full global map, only local map tiles within a defined radius are loaded and used for scan-to-map matching. This reduces memory usage and significantly improves convergence speed of multithreaded NDT-OMP matching.

\subsection{Environmental Adaptability }
Under moderate fog (visibility {60}{m}), both NDT and the fusion method exhibit stable performance, with {APE} increasing only marginally compared to the baseline(Table ~\ref{tab:ape_fog_translation}). This confirms that {NDT} scan matching retains resilience in moderately degraded visibility. However, under severe fog ({visibility 30}{m}), scan matching becomes unreliable due to poor feature correspondences, and {FAST-LIO2} suffers from high drift. As a result, the fusion pipeline repeatedly fails, unable to maintain reliable pose estimates. In sparse map regions and transition zones, scan-to-map registration frequently fails due to a lack of correspondences. Nevertheless, the fusion method maintains localization thanks to high-rate odometry updates and prior structure in the factor graph(Figure~\ref{fig:ape-error-unmapped}).

Dynamic object removal further enhances registration performance. Filtering out transient objects improves convergence, reduces iteration counts, and lowers overall computational load during scan matching(see Table~\ref{tab:dynamic_object_runtime_pipeline_comparison}). While the object detection module introduces some processing overhead, it remains feasible for real-time operation, particularly on GPU-accelerated platforms. However, the system may face limitations on resource-constrained devices without hardware acceleration.

\section{Implications}
These findings underscore the value of combining prior maps, real-time odometry, and probabilistic optimization for autonomous navigation. The approach enables accurate and robust pose estimation in GNSS-denied and moderately degraded visual environments, which are common in urban outdoor and indoor settings. The use of dynamic submap loading and multithreaded NDT further supports the systemâ€™s deployment in real-time and large-scale environments, particularly for high-accuracy, repetitive navigation tasks.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

Despite its strong performance, the proposed localization system has certain limitations. First, it assumes a known and reliable initial pose, and thus cannot handle global localization or recovery in scenarios where the robot is lost or starts without a prior estimate. Second, the system relies entirely on a static prior map without incorporating adaptive updates, which may reduce its effectiveness in environments that change over time.

Future work could address these limitations through the following directions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Global localization and recovery:} Integrating robust initial pose estimation methods to enable map-based localization when the robot starts or becomes lost (kidnapped robot problem).
	\item \textbf{Map adaptability:} Supporting online map updates or incremental SLAM fusion to ensure reliable operation during long-term deployments in dynamic environments.
	\item \textbf{Multi-sensor fusion:} Extending the system to incorporate visual, radar, and LiDAR data for improved robustness and redundancy, particularly under adverse environmental conditions.
\end{itemize}

Together, these directions could further increase the adaptability and autonomy of the system in complex and unstructured environments.
